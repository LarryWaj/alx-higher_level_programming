# alx-higher_level_programming
This a repository of all my endeavors in learning higher level programming on the ALX SE program
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting.
